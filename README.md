                                                                                                                                                             6. Rationale 1: A genetic family history is recommended when there is history of a congenital anomaly, such as cleft lip and palate. A pedigree is a more comprehensive family history, and could follow a genetic family history if needed. The previous anomaly is already known, so a genetic history would be recommended over a genetic physical assessment. A maternal health history is not comprehensive enough for this case.

The nurse is preparing a three-generation family pedigree. A student asks the nurse the significance of the darkened circles. Which response by the nurse is the most appropriate?

Rationale 1: The adolescent is old enough to understand the pros and cons of testing. It would be advisable to discuss the matter with the adolescent and then more fully with the parents. That the minor is not able to give consent is true, but this answer cuts off discussion and is not appropriate. Insurance and discrimination can play a role in the decision, but still are not the appropriate answers because they do not address the issue of the request for testing.

Global Rationale: The adolescent is old enough to understand the pros and cons of testing. It would be advisable to discuss the matter with the adolescent and then more fully with the parents. That the minor is not able to give consent is true, but this answer cuts off discussion and is not appropriate. Insurance and discrimination can play a role in the decision, but still are not the appropriate answers because they do not address the issue of the request for testing.
